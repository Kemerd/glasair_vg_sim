## GPU-CFD landscape (evaluated 2026-06-11/12, decisions in docs/BACKLOG.md)

| Source | Verdict |
|---|---|
| [RapidCFD (SimFlowCFD)](https://github.com/SimFlowCFD/RapidCFD-dev) | Rejected for this study: no transition model (verified in source), 12-year-old base. Parked: cloned in WSL, sm_120-patched, CUDA 12.9 installed. |

## House findings worth citing internally

- Quasi-2D span-periodic LBM domains never reach a stall break (lift keeps
  rising past 20 deg via coherent spanwise rollers); a single mid-span bump
  ("speck") breaks the artificial coherence — see suite reports under
  `gpu/fluidx3d/results/suite/`.
- FluidX3D's voxelizer parity-counts along the minimum-cross-section axis;
  thin plates along that axis can vanish wholesale. Solids smaller than one
  lattice cell in any dimension must be stamped analytically (see the
  stamper in `gpu/fluidx3d/setup_glasair.cpp`) with a one-cell floor.
